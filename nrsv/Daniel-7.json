[{"book":"Daniel","chapter":"7","verse":"1","text":" In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head as he lay in bed.

"},{"book":"Daniel","chapter":"7","verse":"4","text":" The first was like a lion and had eagles&#39 wings.

"},{"book":"Daniel","chapter":"7","verse":"5","text":" Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one side, had three tusks in its mouth among its teeth and was told, &#34Arise, devour many bodies!&#34 "},{"book":"Daniel","chapter":"7","verse":"6","text":" After this, as I watched, another appeared, like a leopard. The beast had four wings of a bird on its back and four heads; and dominion was given to it. "},{"book":"Daniel","chapter":"7","verse":"7","text":" After this I saw in the visions by night a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong.
