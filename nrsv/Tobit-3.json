[{"book":"Tobit","chapter":"3","verse":"1","text":" Then with much grief and anguish of heart I wept, and with groaning began to pray: "},{"book":"Tobit","chapter":"3","verse":"2","text":" &#34You are righteous, O Lord, and all your deeds are just; all your ways are mercy and truth; you judge the world. "},{"book":"Tobit","chapter":"3","verse":"3","text":" And now, O Lord, remember me and look favorably upon me. Do not punish me for my sins and for my unwitting offenses and those that my ancestors committed before you. They sinned against you, "},{"book":"Tobit","chapter":"3","verse":"4","text":" and disobeyed your commandments. So you gave us over to plunder, exile, and death, to become the talk, the byword, and an object of reproach among all the nations among whom you have dispersed us. "},{"book":"Tobit","chapter":"3","verse":"5","text":" And now your many judgments are true in exacting penalty from me for my sins.

Command, O Lord, that I be released from this distress; release me to go to the eternal home, and do not, O Lord, turn your face away from me.

It is better for me not to hang myself, but to pray the Lord that I may die and not listen to these reproaches anymore.&#34 "},{"book":"Tobit","chapter":"3","verse":"11","text":" At that same time, with hands outstretched toward the window, she prayed and said, &#34Blessed are you, merciful God!

For Tobias was entitled to have her before all others who had desired to marry her. At the same time that Tobit returned from the courtyard into his house, Sarah daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room. "}]
