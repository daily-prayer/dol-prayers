"},{"book":"Wisdom","chapter":"14","verse":"2","text":" For it was desire for gain that planned that vessel, and wisdom was the artisan who built it; "},{"book":"Wisdom","chapter":"14","verse":"3","text":" but it is your providence, O Father, that steers its course, because you have given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves, "},{"book":"Wisdom","chapter":"14","verse":"4","text":" showing that you can save from every danger, so that even a person who lacks skill may put to sea. "},{"book":"Wisdom","chapter":"14","verse":"5","text":" It is your will that works of your wisdom should not be without effect; therefore people trust their lives even to the smallest piece of wood, and passing through the billows on a raft they come safely to land.
